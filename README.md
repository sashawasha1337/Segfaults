# Segfaults - Trash Finding Robot Application

Welcome to the **Segfaults Project**, a senior project developed at Sacramento State. This repository contains the codebase for a web application and robot scripts that together power an innovative trash-finding robot. The project demonstrates the integration of robotics, real-time data processing, and a user-friendly web interface to tackle waste management challenges.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Segfaults** project features:

1. **Trash-Finding Robot**: A robot equipped with advanced sensors and AI to detect, locate, and respond to trash in its environment.
2. **Web Application**: A responsive and intuitive interface that enables users to:
   - Monitor the robot's real-time status and location.
   - Control its movements remotely.
   - Visualize trash detection on a map.
   - Manage and analyze collected data.

This project combines robotics, computer vision, and cloud technologies to create a solution for efficient waste management.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Web App
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track the robot's status, location, and trash detection events.
- **Remote Control**: Navigate the robot via an intuitive React-based interface.
- **Trash Visualization**: Display detected trash locations using Leaflet map integration.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access through Firebase authentication.
- **Data Management**: Store and retrieve robot data using Firestore.

### Robot Scripts
- **Camera Integration**: Use OpenCV and ROS to capture and process images.
- **Object Detection**: Implement YOLO-based AI for detecting trash in the robot's environment.
- **Navigation**:
  - GPS-based movement tracking using `gpsReaderScript.cjs`.
  - Lidar-based obstacle avoidance with `avoid_obstacles.py`.
- **Motor Control**: Control DC motors using ROS and GPIO in `MotorNode.py`.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Stream data to Firebase for real-time updates.

#### Robot Scripts
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sashawasha1337/Segfaults.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the `RobotScripts` folder:
   ```bash
   cd Segfaults/RobotScripts
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. For ROS2 nodes, source the ROS2 environment:
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
   ```

4. Run individual scripts as needed, e.g., for the LiDAR node:
   ```bash
   ros2 run RobotScripts avoid_obstacles.py
   ```
